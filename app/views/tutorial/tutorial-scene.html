							This app can wake you up with a random YouTube Music clip. You also can define keywords or enter a YouTube url. Just set the time and enable the alarm to wake up with new music every day.

							If the textfield is empty a random YouTube music video is chosen to wake you up. If you enter a YouTube url this url is played. You can enter keywords and the app will play a random video resulting from the search for this keywords. You can test the content of the textfield by clicking the "Test" Button. I recommend to test your keywords before you set the alarm. Also test the volume. The alarm plays as loud as the music volume does.

							No. You can close the app and put the device into standby. The alarm wakes up the device if it's in standby or brings the app to the front if you are currently using your phone.

							This app relies on an external service (YouTube) which may be temporarily unavailable due to a missing internet connection or something else. For best experience you need a wifi connection. Do not use for critical alarms! I do not guarantee that every video will play. So if you have to rely on the alarm you should use another app to set a second alarm.
